# Animation Layers for Blender

A Blender addon that introduces **true animation layers** inside Blender’s NLA system.  
It lets you add, edit, merge, and manage multiple animation layers with blending and influence control — similar to what animators are used to in Maya or MotionBuilder.

## ✨ Features
- Add and manage **multiple animation layers** on an object.
- Control **visibility**, **soloing**, and **influence** per layer.
- Assign animations to specific layers.
- Edit and tweak layers non-destructively.
- Merge selected layers into a new baked one.
- Reorder layers (move up/down).
- Simple UI in the **3D View > Sidebar > Animation tab**.
